<center><article><p>Negative Light Media (NLM) is the Media company started by Content Creator Negative_light.
Our goal is to createe things in a strong community, from assets used in videos to Minecraft Mods to Content Creator tools we want our code to help others pursue successs.
NLM provides a place for developers to directly interact with Negaitve_light and help him in productions and for some projects might allow them to get contacts or support from NLM.
Ultimatly NLM is what happens when you get a software development company trying that is built on the back of content creation.
This means that our focus might be on getting videos out the door, but we also want to build a strong community of developers so your contributions are welcome.
If you are curious about joining NLM a good first place is our discord so that you can get to know us and the team involved.</p><article></center>
