Then Finaly, run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
if page will not display in browser make sure port 3000 is open, and you have admin(win) or superuser(linux) perms

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
